            == MCI: Managed Compiler Infrastructure ==

                -- Compatibility --

The MCI generally requires version 2.0 of the D language.

The following compilers are supported:

    * Digital Mars D (DMD)
    * GNU D Compiler (GDC)
    * LLVM D Compiler (LDC)

The MCI will probably compile even if you're using an unsupported
compiler, but we cannot in any way guarantee support.

The following architectures are supported:

    * x86 (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * ARM (32-bit)
    * PowerPC (32-bit and 64-bit)
    * Itanium (64-bit)
    * MIPS (32-bit and 64-bit)

Note that PowerPC, Itanium, and MIPS support is not actually implemented,
but is on our roadmap.

Architecture must be determinable when compiling, or the compilation
process will be aborted.

The following operating systems are supported:

    * Windows
    * Linux
    * Mac OS X
    * FreeBSD
    * Solaris
    * AIX

Operating system must be determinable when compiling.

The following emulation layers can optionally be used:

    * Cygwin
    * MinGW

Byte order must also be determined when compiling.

The MCI also depends on the libffi library with full support for the
closure API and the libgc library with full support for the typed GC API
(on POSIX). As far as we are aware, this configuration is available across
all combinations of supported architectures and operating systems. In
addition, on POSIX, we make use of libdl for dynamically loading shared
object files in the VM. This library is present on virtually any POSIX
system, except BSD (where it's included in the standard C library anyway).
This library isn't needed on Windows.

Further, you must have the Clang C compiler (version 2.8 and above)
installed if you plan to use the C back end of the JIT and AOT engines.

Python 2.7+ is needed to run the project's build scripts.
