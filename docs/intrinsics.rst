Intrinsics
==========

The MCI defines a number of built-in functions that can be called by any
program compiled with the infrastructure. These all reside in the ``mci``
module, which is actually implemented in D code inside the ``mci.vm``
library.

All intrinsics are thread safe.

This module is given special treatment by the assembler, so you do not
need to provide a physical module that implements it.

Types
+++++

Object
------

This is an opaque type which is useful for representing an arbitrary
reference type::

    type Object
    {
    }

Weak
----

This is an opaque wrapper type given special treatment by garbage collector
implementations that support it. It facilitates so-called weak references::

    type Weak
    {
    }

Instances of this type should not be manipulated directly. The layout of this
type is completely unspecified and any reliance on it is unsupported. To work
with instances of ``Weak``, use the related intrinsics.

Configuration information
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

These intrinsics retrieve information about the environment the MCI was
compiled in.

Memory management
+++++++++++++++++

gc_collect
----------

**Signature**
    ``void gc_collect()``

Instructs the GC to perform a full collection. This may cause a stop of the
world.

gc_minimize
-----------

**Signature**
    ``void gc_minimize()``

Instructs the GC to do minimal GC work. This function is appropriate for
tight loops, and is relatively cheap.

gc_get_collections
------------------

**Signature**
    ``uint64 gc_get_collections()``

Gets a value indicating the amount of collections the GC has performed.

gc_add_pressure
---------------

**Signature**
    ``void gc_add_pressure(uint)``

argument) is about to be allocated.

argument) is about to be freed.

gc_is_generational
------------------

**Signature**
    ``uint gc_is_generational()``

Gets a value indicating whether the GC is generational.

gc_get_generations
------------------

**Signature**
    ``uint gc_get_generations()``

Gets the amount of generations managed by the GC. This is guaranteed to be a
constant number.

Calling this function if the GC is not generational results in undefined
behavior.

gc_generation_collect
---------------------

**Signature**
    ``void gc_generation_collect(uint)``

Instructs the GC generation given by the ID in the argument to perform a full
collection. This may cause a stop of the world.

Calling this function if the GC is not generational results in undefined
behavior.

gc_generation_minimize
----------------------

**Signature**
    ``void gc_generation_minimize(uint)``

Instructs the GC generation given by the ID in the argument to perform as much
cleanup work as it can without stopping the world.

Calling this function if the GC is not generational results in undefined
behavior.

gc_generation_get_collections
-----------------------------

**Signature**
    ``uint gc_generation_get_collections(uint)``

Gets a value indicating the amount of collections the GC has performed in the
generation given by the ID in the argument.

Calling this function if the GC is not generational results in undefined
behavior.

gc_is_interactive
-----------------

**Signature**
    ``uint gc_is_interactive()``

Gets a value indicating whether the GC is interactive (i.e. supports allocate
and free callbacks). Returns 1 if the GC is interactive; otherwise, returns
0.

gc_add_allocate_callback
------------------------

**Signature**
    ``void gc_add_allocate_callback(void(Object&) cdecl)``

Adds a callback to the GC which will be called on every allocation made in
the program. The parameter given to the function pointer is the newly
allocated object. Note that the callback will be triggered right after the
memory has been allocated.

Calling this function if the GC is not interactive or with a null callback
pointer results in undefined behavior.

gc_remove_allocate_callback
---------------------------

**Signature**
    ``void gc_remove_allocate_callback(void(Object&) cdecl)``

Removes a callback previously added with gc_add_allocate_callback_. If the
given callback was not registered previously, nothing happens.

Calling this function if the GC is not interactive or with a null callback
pointer results in undefined behavior.

gc_set_free_callback
--------------------

**Signature**
    ``void gc_set_free_callback(Object&, void(Object&) cdecl)``

Adds a callback to the GC which will be called on the given object when it is
no longer reachable (i.e. considered garbage). Note that this callback will be
triggered just before the memory is actually freed. Passing a null value as the
second argument will remove any existing callback for the given object. Passing
any other value when a callback is already registered simply overwrites the
existing callback.

The callback is automatically removed when the object is freed.

Calling this function if the GC is not interactive or with a null object results
in undefined behavior.

gc_wait_for_free_callbacks
--------------------------

**Signature**
    ``void gc_wait_for_free_callbacks()``

Blocks the current thread until all free callbacks that are currently enqueued
have been processed by the finalization thread.

gc_is_atomic
------------

**Signature**
    ``uint gc_is_atomic()``

barriers). Returns 1 if the GC is atomic; otherwise, returns 0.

gc_get_barriers

Possible flags:

===== ===============================================
0x00  No barriers are required.
0x01  Read barriers are required for fields.
0x02  Write barriers are required for fields.
0x04  Read barriers are required for array loads.
0x08  Write barriers are required for array stores.
0x10  Read barriers are required for indirect stores.
0x20  Write barriers are required for indirect loads.
===== ===============================================

Math and IEEE 754 operations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

nan_with_payload_f32
--------------------

**Signature**
    ``float32 nan_with_payload_f32(uint32)``

Produces a NaN (not a number) value with a given user payload. This abuses an
obscure feature of IEEE 754 that allows 22 bits of a NaN value to be set to a
user-specified value. This does of course mean that only 22 bits of the given
payload will be inserted in the NaN value.

nan_with_payload_f64
--------------------

**Signature**
    ``float64 nan_with_payload_f64(uint64)``

Produces a NaN (not a number) value with a given user payload. This abuses an
obscure feature of IEEE 754 that allows 51 bits of a NaN value to be set to a
user-specified value. This does of course mean that only 51 bits of the given
payload will be inserted in the NaN value.

nan_get_payload_f32
-------------------

**Signature**
    ``uint32 nan_get_payload_f32(float32)``

Extracts the 22-bit payload stored in a NaN (not a number) value.

nan_get_payload_f64
-------------------

**Signature**
    ``uint64 nan_get_payload_f64(float64)``

Extracts the 51-bit payload stored in a NaN (not a number) value.

is_nan_f32
----------

**Signature**
    ``uint is_nan_f32(float32)``

Returns 1 if the given value is NaN (not a number); otherwise, returns 0. This
function is payload-aware, so NaNs with payloads will correctly be regarded
NaN.

is_nan_f64
----------

**Signature**
    ``uint is_nan_f64(float64)``

Returns 1 if the given value is NaN (not a number); otherwise, returns 0. This
function is payload-aware, so NaNs with payloads will correctly be regarded
NaN.

is_inf_f32
----------

**Signature**
    ``uint is_inf_f32(float32)``

Returns 1 if the given value is positive or negative infinity; otherwise,
returns 0.

is_inf_f64
----------

**Signature**
    ``uint is_inf_f64(float64)``

Returns 1 if the given value is positive or negative infinity; otherwise,
returns 0.

Weak references
+++++++++++++++

create_weak
-----------

**Signature**
    ``Weak& create_weak(Object&)``

Creates a weak reference to an object given in the first parameter. Calling
this function with a null parameter results in undefined behavior.

This function returns null if insufficient memory is available. The weak
reference returned by this intrinsic must not be freed with ``mem.free`` or
any other deallocation mechanism.

get_weak_target
---------------

**Signature**
    ``Object& get_weak_target(Weak&)``

Gets the target of a given weak reference. Calling this function with a null
weak reference results in undefined behavior.

The returned object may be null, since the target of the weak reference could
have been collected since it was set.

set_weak_target
---------------

**Signature**
    ``void set_weak_target(Weak&, Object&)``

Sets the target of a given weak reference. Calling this function with a null
weak reference results in undefined behavior.
