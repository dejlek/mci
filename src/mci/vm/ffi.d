/**
 * Opens a dynamic link library. This will typically be a $(PRE .so) file
 * on POSIX systems, $(PRE .dylib) on OS X, or $(PRE .dll) on Windows.
 *
 * This function first attempts to load from the current directory (only if
 * $(D name) is a base name), then whatever directories the system searches
 * in.
 *
 * Attempts to resolve symbols lazily when possible.
 *
 * This actually uses a reference counting mechanism. When a library is first
 * loaded, its reference count is set to one. For each subsequent load of the
 * same library, it is incremented by one.
 *
 * Params:
 *  name = The name of the library to load. If this is a base name (i.e. no
 *         directory separators), this function will attempt to load the file
 *         from the current directory first.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  A handle to the library on success, or $(D null) on failure.
